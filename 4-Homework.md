### 1. What does one need to do to use a module?

* One would have to import the module into the code-base, using the import statement.
    
### 2. Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.

* Python Math Module.

    #### import math
    #### print('Square root ...' math.sqrt(144))
    #### print('Square ...', 12.0**2)

### 3. What is a benefit of using Exception handling? 

* Exception handling allows us to move past many errors.

### 4. NumPy arrays are like what Python data type?

* Lists

### 5. What is one of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays.

* NumPy arrays are faster.

### 6. What is one of the main requirements about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?

* Homogeneous (same data type)

### 7. Of the 10 uses of NumPy, name 2.

* Arithmetic operations and Linear algebra. 

### 8. Name one of the other libraries we'll use with NumPy?

* Pandas

### 9. What is the shape of NumPy arrays?

* The shape is a tuple of non-negative integers that specify the dimentions, length and size of each array (3,2,4). 

### 10 What is a Tensor?

* An arry with 3 or more dimensions. 

### 11. Name a reason why it's better using NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?

* NumPy arrays occupy less memory as compared to list.

### 12 When creating an "empty" array, where do the elements come from?

* The elements are random and depends on the state of the memory.
